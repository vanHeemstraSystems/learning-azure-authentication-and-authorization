# Design for Azure Key Vault
When building an app that uses Azure Active Directory to provide sign-in and access tokens for secured endpoints, there are a few good practices you should follow.

Why use Key Vault?

- Separation of sensitive app information from other configuration and code, reducing the risk of accidental leaks.
- Restricted secret access with access policies tailored to the apps and individuals that need them.
- Centralized secret storage, allowing required changes to happen in only one place.
- Access logging and monitoring to help you understand how and when secrets are accessed.
- Implementing Customer Managed Keys for Azure services.

When to consider multiple Key Vaults:

- RBAC vs Policies
- Performance
